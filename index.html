            <li><strong>When to Use:</strong> Complete graphs are suitable for modeling scenarios where there is a strong relationship between every pair of distinct entities, such as fully interconnected communication networks or fully connected social networks.</li>
            <li><strong>When Not to Use:</strong> Avoid using complete graphs for large-scale networks with many nodes, as the number of edges grows quadratically with the number of nodes, leading to high computational and storage requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Why We Use:</strong> Complete graphs provide a simple and intuitive way to model fully connected relationships between entities, enabling efficient analysis of global network properties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Think of a complete graph as a group of friends where everyone is friends with everyone else. In a complete graph, every person (node) is directly connected to every other person (node) in the group.</p>

            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A graph that consists of a subset of the nodes and edges of a larger graph.</li>
            <li><strong>When to Use:</strong> Subgraphs are useful for analyzing specific parts or subsets of larger graphs, focusing on particular relationships or components within the graph.</li>
            <li><strong>When Not to Use:</strong> Avoid using subgraphs if you need to analyze the entire graph or if the subset of nodes and edges doesn't provide meaningful insights into the larger structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Why We Use:</strong> Subgraphs allow us to break down complex graphs into manageable parts, facilitating targeted analysis and exploration of specific relationships or components.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A subgraph is like taking a portion of a big picture. Let's say you have a large map of a city, and you zoom in to focus on just one neighborhood. That neighborhood map is a subgraph of the larger city map.</p>

     <h3>Adjacency Matrix:</h3>
        <ul class="adjacency-matrix-info">
            <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> An adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent the connections between nodes in a graph. Each cell in the matrix indicates whether there is an edge between the corresponding nodes.</li>
            <li><strong>When to Use:</strong> Adjacency matrices are suitable for representing dense graphs with many edges, as they provide a compact way to store connectivity information between nodes.</li>
            <li><strong>When Not to Use:</strong> Avoid using adjacency matrices for sparse graphs with few edges, as they can result in inefficient memory usage and computational overhead.</li>
            <li><strong>Why We Use:</strong> Adjacency matrices enable fast access to edge information and support efficient matrix-based operations, making them ideal for certain graph algorithms and analyses.</li>
            <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> An adjacency matrix is like a table that shows who is friends with whom. Each row and column represents a person (node), and if there's a mark where a row and column intersect, it means those two people (nodes) are friends (connected).</li>
            <li><strong>When to Use:</strong> Use when you want to quickly see who is connected to whom in your graph, especially if there are many connections.</li>

        <h3>Adjacency List:</h3>
        <ul class="adjacency-list-info">
            <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> An adjacency list is a data structure used to represent the connections between nodes by storing a list of neighbors for each node. Each node has a list of other nodes it's directly connected to.</li>
            <li><strong>When to Use:</strong> Adjacency lists are suitable for representing sparse graphs with few edges, as they offer efficient memory usage by only storing connections for each node.</li>
            <li><strong>When Not to Use:</strong> Avoid using adjacency lists for dense graphs with many edges, as they may result in higher memory overhead compared to adjacency matrices.</li>
            <li><strong>Why We Use:</strong> Adjacency lists facilitate efficient traversal and exploration of graph structures, especially in scenarios where memory efficiency is a concern.</li>
            <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> An adjacency list is like having a list of friends for each person. Each person (node) has a list of their friends (nodes they are connected to). You can quickly see who someone is friends with by looking at their list.</li>

        <ul class="incidence-matrix-info">
            <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> An incidence matrix is used to represent which nodes are incident to each edge in a graph. Each row represents a node, and each column represents an edge. A cell contains a 1 if the corresponding node is incident to the edge, otherwise 0.</li>
            <li><strong>When to Use:</strong> Incidence matrices are useful for representing relationships between nodes and edges in directed graphs or graphs with edge-specific attributes, such as edge weights or capacities.</li>
            <li><strong>When Not to Use:</strong> Avoid using incidence matrices for undirected graphs with simple edge connections, as they may result in unnecessary complexity and overhead.</li>
            <li><strong>Why We Use:</strong> Incidence matrices provide a structured way to represent node-edge relationships and support various graph algorithms and analyses, particularly those involving directed graphs or edge-specific attributes.</li>
            <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> An incidence matrix shows which nodes are involved in each edge. It's like a table where rows represent nodes, columns represent edges, and a mark in a cell means the node is part of that edge.</li>

            <li><strong>Real-time Example:</strong> In a web crawler, traversal is used to systematically visit and index web pages on the internet. BFS might visit all pages on a single website before moving to the next, while DFS might explore deeper into each website before moving to the next.</li>
            <li><strong>When to Use:</strong> Traversal algorithms are used to systematically visit all nodes in a graph, making them essential for various graph-based tasks such as pathfinding, connectivity analysis, and data processing.</li>
